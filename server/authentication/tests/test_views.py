Code Analysis

Main functionalities:
The CsrfTokenViewSet class is a viewset that retrieves the CSRF token and sets it as a cookie. It is used to ensure that requests made to the server are legitimate and not forged. This class is designed to be used with Django and the Django Rest Framework.

Methods:
- get_csrf_token: This method retrieves the CSRF token and sets it as a cookie. It is decorated with the ensure_csrf_cookie decorator to ensure that the CSRF cookie is set correctly.

Fields:
- permission_classes: This field is set to AllowAny, which means that any user can access the CSRF token. This is necessary because the CSRF token is required for all requests to the server, including those made by unauthenticated users.
